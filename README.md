## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The vehicle length and ground clearance have p values that are below the 0.05 signifcance level and therefore we can conclude that these factors have the most impact on the mpg. The summary includes that the overall p value is 5.35e-11 and this is also below the 0.05 signoficance level. Therefore there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which was that the slope of the linear model is zero. The alternative hypothesis is the slope is not zero. Finally, the r squared value is 0.71 which means that the model accounts for 71% of the variablility. The p value is statistically significant with a high r square value therefore this model is effective in predicting the mpg outside the data set.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
From the total summary, we can see that the variance is 62.29 which is below the requirement. However, under the lot summary, we see that the variance is 170.29 for Lot 3. Therefore lot 3 does not meet the requirements of having a variance less than 100 PSI.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
